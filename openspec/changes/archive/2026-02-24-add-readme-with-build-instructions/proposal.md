## Why

The project lacks a README file with clear build and deployment instructions. New contributors or users who clone the repository need to know how to build, run, and deploy the Jekyll blog.

## What Changes

- Create a README.md file at the project root
- Add installation instructions (bundle install)
- Add local development instructions (bundle exec jekyll serve)
- Add build instructions (bundle exec jekyll build)
- Add deployment instructions for GitHub Pages
- Document the custom theme structure
- Document how to add new posts

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `readme`: Project documentation with build and deployment instructions

### Modified Capabilities
- None

## Impact

- New README.md file at project root
- Affected: Developer onboarding, deployment process
